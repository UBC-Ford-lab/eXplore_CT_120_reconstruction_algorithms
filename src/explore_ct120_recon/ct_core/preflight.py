"""Machine preflight: will this reconstruction fit on this machine?

Run by every driver after the scan is loaded (all shapes known) and BEFORE
any backend allocates GPU or large host buffers. Checks three things against
per-backend requirement estimates:

  1. Is a CUDA GPU present at all? (ASTRA and TIGRE algorithms are CUDA-only
     and would crash mid-run; FDK and the voxel trainer fall back to CPU,
     which is allowed but loudly warned — orders of magnitude slower.)
  2. Does the estimated peak VRAM fit in the GPU's free memory?
  3. Does the estimated peak host RAM fit in MemAvailable?

Each backend answers with a ``Footprint``, and the backends are a REGISTRY
(``FOOTPRINTS`` / ``register_footprint``) rather than a chain of
``if backend ==``. That matters for the learning-based family: a new
representation must be able to say how big it is without editing this file,
because its size is a fact about the representation and not about CT. The
dense voxel grid is the one learned backend registered here, and only because
its parameters ARE the exported volume — a shape this module already has.
Anything else (an INR's weight count, a splat count) arrives as
``footprint=(MachineRequest) -> Footprint`` from the algorithm itself; see
``learning_based_iterative.registry``.

A ``Footprint`` splits VRAM into what is RESIDENT for the whole run and what
scales with the ray batch. That split is not cosmetic: ``auto_rays_per_batch``
sizes the batch as "free VRAM minus resident, divided by per-ray", so a single
total would not answer the question. It is also where a network differs most
from a voxel grid — resident weights are megabytes, not gigabytes, so the same
card affords a far larger batch.

The estimates are deliberately simple, documented formulas with a safety
margin — they exist to catch the "this cannot possibly work" and "this will
be uncomfortably tight" cases up front, not to be byte-accurate:

  fdk    VRAM: processes in z-chunks sized to free VRAM at runtime, so the
         requirement is the sinogram + one modest volume slab.
         RAM: raw projections + float sinogram + full volume.
  astra  VRAM: 2x volume + 2x sinogram (SIRT/CGLS keep forward/back-projection
         buffers — same formula the backend itself uses).
         RAM: projections (float, x2 for the ASTRA reorder copy) + volume.
  tigre  VRAM: TIGRE splits internally, so the floor is the sinogram + one
         volume split; a note says larger free VRAM = fewer splits = faster.
         RAM: ~4x volume + ~3x sinogram (measured: 12 GB RSS at a 2.9 GiB
         volume — TIGRE and the crossval path keep several copies).
  learned  (voxel, and any representation registered beside it) VRAM:
         parameters x the optimizer's state count (4x for Adam: param + grad
         + m + v; 2x for plain SGD, which keeps no state) + sinogram +
         per-batch ray buffers. RAM: raw projections + float sinogram +
         exported volume. The shared shape is `learned_footprint`; only the
         PARAMETER COUNT differs per representation, and only the algorithm
         knows it.

Verdicts: ok / tight (>85% of free) / insufficient / no-gpu. `insufficient`
and `no-gpu`(when the backend requires one) abort with a clear message —
``--skip-preflight`` overrides, ``--preflight-only`` prints the report and
exits without reconstructing (for sizing jobs before submitting them).
