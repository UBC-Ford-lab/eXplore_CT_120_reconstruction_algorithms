"""When to stop iterating — one implementation, three criteria, every backend.

Iterative and learning-based reconstruction both SEMI-CONVERGE: the residual
keeps falling long after the reconstruction has started getting worse, because
the extra fit is going into noise. So "run to convergence" is the wrong
instruction and every backend needs a stopping rule. Three are offered here,
and they are not redundant — they disagree about what "worse" means:

* **Held-out projection** (`HoldoutScorer` + `EarlyStopper`). Withhold one
  projection, forward-project the current estimate at that angle, and score it.
  Measures GENERALISATION directly, which is the thing you actually want, and
  needs no assumption about the noise. Costs one projection's worth of data and
  one forward projection per checkpoint. SSIM, PSNR and MSE are all available as
  the criterion, because they peak at different iterations: MSE is the objective
  and peaks last, SSIM is structural and turns over earliest.

* **L-curve** (`LCurve`). Plot the residual norm against the solution norm in
  log-log as the iteration advances; the corner is where further residual
  reduction starts buying disproportionate solution growth, i.e. where noise
  amplification takes over. Needs **no held-out data at all**, which is its real
  advantage — on a short scan, or any scan where you cannot afford to drop an
  angle, it is the only one of the three that applies. Classical: Hansen &
  O'Leary (1993).

* **Plateau LR reduction** (`PlateauLRReducer`). Learning-based backends only:
  the *closed-loop* half of stopping. An open-loop LR schedule assumes a fixed
  horizon the run never reaches, so the annealing phase never happens. This
  drives the LR down on the same signal the stopper watches, and the loop stops
  only once the LR is at its floor and the metric still will not improve.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. There were three separate implementations of the first
criterion — TIGRE's inside `iterative/tigre/reconstructor.py`, the voxel
trainer's inline, and muNeRF's `inr_pipeline/early_stop.py` — and ASTRA had
none. They differed in ways that mattered:

* TIGRE scored its stopping SSIM with **skimage's default 7x7 uniform window**
  on the FULL projection, while the `diag/ssim` it logged to W&B came from
  `ct_core.ssim`'s 11x11 Gaussian window on the domain-covered CROP. The number
  that decided when to stop was therefore not the number you could see, and
  neither was comparable with any other backend's.
* The voxel trainer stopped on held-out MSE but then returned the LAST iterate,
  not the best one — so it detected the turnover and kept the volume from after
  it.

One scorer, one tracker, one figure. `inr_pipeline/early_stop.py` is now an
alias to this module.

#
# They are deliberately generous, because the two errors are not symmetric.
# `EarlyStopper` captures the best state and the callers restore it, so
# stopping LATE costs wall-clock and nothing else — the volume returned is the

# whatever the run would have done next. MEASURED case that set these: an
# --emulate-sart run at lambda=1 plateaued from iteration 500 while its cosine
# schedule still intended to reduce the step by three orders of magnitude; the
# old default ended it at iteration 2500 of 20000 (12.5%), during the
# high-step phase, so the annealing the schedule existed for never happened.

DEFAULT_PATIENCE_EVALS = 8

#: Floor on patience when a PlateauLRReducer is driving the LR. Lower than the

#: another eight in a row re-asks a question that has been answered. MEASURED
#: on run ny96yzab: 8 -> 4 is the single largest saving available (11.7 h ->

    steep drop while the reconstruction is still fitting SIGNAL, then a flat run
