Projection preprocessing: transmission -> line integrals.

This module owns steps 1-2 of the standard chain, which turn raw detector
counts into the line integrals a reconstructor consumes:

1. Flat-field correction: T = (I - I_dark) / (I_bright - I_dark)
2. Log transformation:    p = -log(T)

Step 3 is the reconstruction itself, which yields the linear attenuation
coefficient mu (mm^-1).

Step 4 -- the HU conversion -- deliberately does NOT live here. It is fitted
once, downstream of every backend, in ``ct_core.hu_calibration``, from two
anchors measured in the reconstructed volume's own histogram. The one-point
map that used to live in this file (``mu_to_hu``, plus a family of phantom
insert-ROI polynomial fitters) has been removed: it fitted a single degree of
freedom against an affine error, relied on a scanner constant back-fitted to
one 2022 scan that did not transfer between reconstructions, and clipped to
[-1024, 4095] before anything could measure the volume -- which pinned 19-44 %
of all voxels onto the floor and destroyed the air peak.

The name is kept because the flat/dark fields it loads are the scanner's
calibration frames.

        this discontinuity into characteristic center ringing artifacts.

        Soft clipping uses softplus for a smooth transition, preventing Gibbs ringing
        while still enforcing the minimum transmission floor.

        Upper clamping prevents T > 1 values (from noise/calibration mismatch) from
        creating negative line integrals. The boundary where T crosses 1.0 can create
