"""Projection-domain diagnostics shared by every reconstruction backend.

Ported from muNeRF's ``inr_pipeline/metrics.py`` + ``train.py`` diagnostics
(2026-08-13) so ALL backends — FDK, ASTRA, TIGRE, voxel — report the same
projection-quality evidence:

  * ``ssim_2d`` / ``psnr_2d``   — canonical pure-torch implementations
    (muNeRF's ``inr_pipeline.metrics`` re-exports these; single identity).
  * ``evaluate_projection``     — SSIM / PSNR / MSE of a predicted vs
    measured projection (numpy in, plain floats out).
  * ``measure_noise_ceiling``   — the noise-limited SSIM/PSNR ceiling and
    MSE floor from two independent measurements of the same line integrals:
    the OTHER acquisition phase when the scan has one (e.g. Scan_1510's
    acq-01 frames), else the neighbouring projection (conservative — it
    also carries ~one angular step of real signal change).
  * ``render_projection_from_volume`` — forward-project a finished volume
    at one angle through the canonical ray tracer, so non-streaming
    backends (FDK, ASTRA) get the same diagnostics as iterative ones.
  * ``ssim_heatmap_figure`` / ``power_spectrum_figure`` — the muNeRF
    diagnostic figures, without their FDK-baseline panels.

The evaluation projection is by convention the CENTRAL angle
(``n_angles // 2``) — the same projection every holdout/crossval scheme in
this repo has always used — and by default it stays IN the reconstruction
(diagnostic, not validation). Drivers expose ``--withhold-eval`` to turn it
into a true held-out validation projection.

    """``(volume - air_level, air_level)`` — air moved to mu = 0.

    The forward model assumes a ray through air integrates to nothing. A
    reconstruction's air does not land exactly at zero: the offset is real and
    physical (``hu_calibration``'s own ``c``, from scatter, truncation and the
    support bias), and the HU fit already MEASURES it as ``value_air``.

    PATH LENGTH IS THE AMPLIFIER, which is why a number this small matters.
    MEASURED on Scan_1510's FDK: value_air = -0.000828 mm^-1, about 4 % of
    water, but a ray crosses ~60 mm of domain, so it displaces every line
    integral by -0.050 against a measured value of ~0.15. A 4 % error in the
    volume is a 33 % error in the projection, and `gain_fit` reports it as a
    1.3x density error that is not there.

    Subtracting it is EXACT, because the forward model is linear:
    ``A(mu - a) = A(mu) - a*A(1)``, so this shifts every ray by exactly the
    amount the air offset contributes and changes nothing else.

    This REPLACES a `np.clip(volume, 0, None)` that used to sit in
    `render_projection_from_volume`. Clipping is nonlinear: it fixed the air
    level only by accident (air is where most negative voxels are) and paid for
    it by destroying the edge undershoot, which is real signal. MEASURED on the
    same volume, at the scored angle: clipped 22.09 dB, neither 17.08 dB,
    levelled 23.25 dB, with the affine intercept collapsing +0.062 -> -0.009.

    Levelling is NOT applied to anything stored — a delivered volume keeps the
    offset it measured, because that offset is a result. This is for the
    forward model alone.

    CAVEATS, both measured. It removes the AIR share of the offset and nothing
    else: a volume cropped to the export ROI keeps its truncation offset
    (+0.043 after levelling, unchanged). And it is not automatically an
    improvement — where ``value_air`` is already ~0 (any softplus-based
    backend) it is a no-op to within noise, and can move a score either way.

    ``anchors`` supplies the level when the caller already has it; otherwise it
    is fitted from this volume's own histogram, the same estimator that wrote
    it. Never raises: an unfittable volume is left alone.

    a measured air level that flat-fielding left slightly below zero collapses
    to ~0 (or negative) even though the absolute error is tiny.

    A ray at fan angle gamma passes the axis at perpendicular distance

    Note this is WIDER than the isocentre magnification r*SDD/R_s that the

    """Render one projection through a reconstructed volume.

    Uses the canonical ray tracer (learning_based_iterative scene/renderer)
    with a trilinear VoxelGrid wrapping `volume`, so FDK/ASTRA volumes get
    the exact same forward model the learning-based backends train with.

    `volume` is (Nx, Ny, Nz) spanning geometry['vol_shape'] (the backend
    contract); `measured` is the PREPROCESSED evaluation projection
    (N_b, N_a). Returns (pred, target) numpy arrays at `downsample` stride.

    `geometry` overrides `ctx.geometry`. A driver reconstructing its own
    volume never needs it; a POST-HOC caller scoring a foreign volume does,
    because the grid that volume lives on is a property of the file, not of
    the scan — pass ctx.geometry with vol_shape/vol_origin/dx/dz replaced by
    the volume's own and every other entry (the projection geometry) left
    alone. That forward-projects each volume at its NATIVE resolution, which
    is what a comparison wants: resampling onto a common lattice would soften
    the sharper volume before measuring how sharp it is.

    `window` pins the scored detector rectangle to (b_min, b_max, a_min,
    a_max) instead of deriving it from the domain. THIS MATTERS FOR ANY
    COMPARISON: the window `covered_detector_window` returns depends on the
    reconstruction domain, so two volumes with different extents would
    otherwise be scored over different parts of the detector and their
    SSIM/PSNR would not be comparable. Pass the intersection over every
    volume in the comparison.

    """The noise ceiling averaged over EVERY view, not just the eval angle.

    ``measure_noise_ceiling`` scores one projection, which is enough to put a
    line on a plot but is a single sample of a quantity that varies with view:
    the ceiling depends on how much attenuation a given angle sees, so a lateral
    view and an AP view do not share it. Averaging over all of them gives the
    number a run should actually be compared against, and the spread says how
    meaningful the comparison is.

    Both arguments are PREPROCESSED sinograms (A, N_b, N_a) of the same scan
    measured twice — in practice two acquisition phases. With b = s+n and
    b' = s+n' independent, E[(b-b')^2] = 2*sigma^2, so the best mean-squared
    error any model can honestly reach is ``0.5 * mean((b-b')^2)``; that is the
    ``mse_floor`` returned here, in the sinogram's own units.

    ``stride`` subsamples the detector the way a diagnostic render does, so the
    ceiling is measured on the same grid the model is scored on — SSIM is not
    invariant to resolution, and a ceiling computed at full resolution would
    not be comparable to a downsampled diagnostic. ``window`` is an optional
    ``(b0, b1, a0, a1)`` crop, for scoring only the detector region whose rays
    stay inside the reconstruction domain.
