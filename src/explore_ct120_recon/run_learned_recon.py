"""
Run learning-based iterative cone-beam CT reconstruction.

The volume is a differentiable representation fitted to the measured line
integrals by gradient descent through a differentiable forward projector
(reconstruction as optimization — the same argmin classical iterative recon
solves, with autograd replacing the hand-derived update rule).

Algorithms (each in its own subfolder of ``learning_based_iterative/``, each
registering a ``LearnedAlgorithm`` descriptor — see that package's
``registry``):
  - voxel: dense voxel grid — SIRT's representation trained with Adam + MSE.

``--algorithm`` selects over the registry, and nothing in this file knows
which one it got. A representation contributes its own CLI flags, its own
constructor arguments and its own machine footprint through the descriptor,
so adding one touches ``learning_based_iterative`` and not this driver.

All algorithm-independent stages (scan loading, geometry build, detector
downsampling, detector-psi calibration, HU calibration + VFF export) live in
ct_core.pipeline and are shared with the FDK / iterative drivers.

    logger — none of which the trainer knows about, and none of which it
    should have to.

    The HU map is refitted on EVERY frame and the gain it found is written
    into the title and logged as a scalar. It was fitted ONCE, on stage 0,
    and reused for the whole sequence, so that a change in the picture could
    only ever be a change in the reconstruction. That argument was right
    about what it wanted and wrong about how to get it: stage 0 is the
    reducer TAKEOVER, a few hundred iterations in, and the volume there has
    not yet grown to its physical attenuation. The histogram fit is scale-
    EQUIVARIANT on purpose — it has to work on volumes in arbitrary units —
    so a volume whose mu is f times too small returns a gain 1/f times too
    large, and that gain then saturates every later frame to white.

    MEASURED on a finished Scan_1510 volume, shrinking its mu and refitting:

        mu x f    implied mu_water    real soft tissue (mu 0.0235) lands at
          1.0          0.02312                        +132 HU

    No quality gate catches this. Prominence, tissue mass and the block-
    average corroboration are all scale-invariant and read IDENTICALLY at
    every f (0.677 in all three rows above), because a shrunken volume is a
    perfectly well-formed histogram — just not one in mm^-1.

    Refitting per frame cannot fail that way: a bad fit stays inside the
    frame that produced it. The objection it raises — a drifting gain then
    looks like a change in contrast — is answered by REPORTING the gain
    instead of freezing it, so the two are told apart by reading a number.
