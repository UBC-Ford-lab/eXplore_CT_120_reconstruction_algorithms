TIGRE-based iterative cone-beam CT reconstruction.

Provides OS-SART, SART, and SIRT reconstruction using the TIGRE toolbox
as an alternative backend to ASTRA. TIGRE handles GPU memory splitting
internally, potentially enabling larger-than-VRAM reconstructions on
memory-constrained GPUs.

The geometry mapping translates the FDK backprojection coordinate convention
(fdk.py lines 598-612) into TIGRE's geometry object.

    This is what ``IterativeReconAlg.set_w`` computes internally, reproduced
    here for one reason: TIGRE's version pins ``nVoxel = [2, 2, 2]`` and that
    grid HANGS THE CUDA KERNEL for some field sizes.

    THE BUG, located 2026-08-19. ``set_w`` does not project the reconstruction
    volume — it builds a stand-in box (transaxial extent x1.1, z at least the
    detector height) and forces ``nVoxel`` to 2 per axis, so only the PHYSICAL
    extent ever reaches the kernel. In ``Siddon_projection.cu`` the ray walk is

        float imin,imax,jmin,jmax,kmin,kmax;          // <- float
        unsigned long Np = (imax-imin+1)+(jmax-jmin+1)+(kmax-kmin+1);
        for (unsigned long ii=0; ii<Np; ii++){ ... }

    For rays that graze or miss the box those bounds go degenerate, and the
    float->unsigned long conversion turns the intersection count into an
    astronomically large ``Np``, so the loop never ends. With only 2 voxels per
    axis the index arithmetic is coarse enough that whether any ray lands there
    flips with small changes in box size, detector width and angle set —
    MEASURED as a non-monotone hang BAND in physical millimetres, independent
    of the reconstruction's own voxel count (which never reaches the kernel).
    Signature: 100% GPU utilisation with ~325 MiB allocated, because the hang
    happens before anything large is allocated.

    THE FIX. A box of ones has line integral = chord length whatever the voxel
    count, so a finer grid is the same quantity computed on a grid that does
    not trip the degeneracy. MEASURED at 81.4 mm, where TIGRE's own grid still
    works: grid=8 and grid=2 agree to 0.000% median AND p99 relative difference
    over every ray with a real path (they differ only on grazing rays, which
    the mask below sends to inf anyway). Supplying ``W`` also means
    ``IterativeReconAlg.__init__`` never calls ``set_w`` at all — it is guarded
    by ``if not hasattr(self, "W")`` — so the hang cannot occur. A geometry
    that hung indefinitely reconstructs in 11.6 s this way.

    correction already removed per-pixel gain nonuniformity), and the PWLS
    objective (Ax-p)^T diag(w) (Ax-p) is invariant to a uniform positive

                That update is the ML step for an EMISSION-Poisson model
                (counts ~ Poisson(Ax)), and TIGRE — being a CBCT toolbox
                whose Ax returns line integrals — applies it to TRANSMISSION

                weighted least squares with weight ~1/p_i, whereas quantum
                noise on a transmission ray gives var(p_i) ~ 1/N_i and so the

                SIRT converges for any lambda in (0, 2) — the iteration matrix
                C A^T R A has spectral radius <= 1 under these row/column
                normalisations — so 1.0 is the unrelaxed textbook choice.
                Lower values smooth the trajectory and suppress early streaks
                at roughly proportional cost in iterations; they are worth
                considering for the ORDERED-SUBSET methods (ossart, sart),

                sum(lambda_k) = lmbda / (1 - lmbda_red) and is FINITE for any
                lmbda_red < 1: the iterate converges to wherever the shrinking

            clamp_mode: Line integral clamping mode ('none', 'soft', 'hard')
            soft_clip_transmission: Use soft clipping for transmission floor
            soft_clip_sharpness: Sharpness of soft clip transition
            upper_clamp: Clamp transmission from above
            upper_clamp_value: Maximum allowed transmission value
            ring_correction: Apply sinogram-space ring artifact correction
            ring_median_width: Median filter width for ring correction (odd int)
            crossval: bool. If True (default), evaluate PSNR/SSIM/MSE against
                the evaluation projection every eval_every iterations.
                Reconstruction stops early when SSIM stops improving
                (patience-based). The saved volume is the one at peak SSIM,
                not the final iteration.
            holdout_index: int or None. Index of the evaluation projection.
                None (default) auto-selects the middle projection (N_angles // 2).
                Ignored when crossval=False.
            withhold_eval: bool. If True, the evaluation projection is REMOVED
                from the reconstruction input (true held-out validation, the
                pre-2026-08-13 behaviour). Default False: the projection is
                reconstructed from and evaluated against (diagnostic).
            eval_every: int. Evaluate holdout metrics every this many iterations.
                (default: 10)
            patience: int. Stop early if SSIM fails to improve for this many
                consecutive eval checkpoints. (default: 3)
            tv_lambda: TV denoising parameter passed to im3ddenoise after each
                iteration chunk. 0.0 (default) disables TV entirely.
                im3ddenoise normalises the volume to [0,1] internally, so this
                value is scan-independent. TIGRE minimises (1/2)||u-f||² +
                TV(u)/λ, so HIGHER λ = LESS smoothing (weaker TV), LOWER λ =
                MORE smoothing (stronger TV). λ=0 disables TV; λ→∞ approaches
                plain SIRT. Useful range for micro-CT: 10–50. λ=10 gives
                visible noise suppression; λ<5 is destructively over-smooth.
            tv_iters: Chambolle-Pock TV denoising iterations applied at each
                TV step (default 50). Higher values converge the TV sub-problem
                more fully; 50 matches the TIGRE OSSART-TV default.
            pwls: bool. If True, replaces the algorithm's default purely-
                geometric per-ray weight with a PWLS (penalized weighted
                least squares) weight that additionally down-weights rays
                with low estimated transmission (noisier measurements),
                approximating a maximum-likelihood weighting under a
                quantum-noise model. See _pwls_weight() for the derivation.
                Composes with tv_lambda (TV step is unaffected — it acts in
                the image domain, PWLS only reweights the data-fidelity
                term) and with crossval/early stopping. Default False
                (plain geometric weighting, i.e. standard SIRT/SART).
                Incompatible with algorithm='mlem': MLEM.__init__ (TIGRE's
                tigre/algorithms/statistical_algorithms.py) unconditionally
                overrides any passed-in W with its own Atb(ones) sensitivity
                map, so a PWLS W array would be silently discarded rather
                than applied — raises ValueError instead of failing silently.
                Note this is a mechanical incompatibility, not a redundancy:
                MLEM carries its OWN implicit ray weighting (~1/p, see
                algorithm above), and that weighting is the emission one, not
                the transmission photon weighting pwls computes here.
            checkpoint_dir: str or None. If set and crossval=True, save a
                cropped copy of the reconstructed volume at every crossval
                eval checkpoint (every eval_every iterations), in the same
                on-disk orientation/HU-calibration as the final saved
                volume (see _to_disk_volume). Written as
                '{checkpoint_dir}/iter{i:04d}.npy' (float32). A
                'crossval_metrics.json' (self.crossval_metrics) is also
                written to this directory once reconstruction finishes, so
                each checkpoint's SSIM/PSNR/MSE is available without
                re-parsing logs. Intended for tracking how image-quality
                metrics (MTF/NPS/d') evolve over iterations, independent of
                the crossval SSIM used for early stopping. Default None
                (disabled). Ignored when crossval=False (no per-checkpoint
                volume exists to save).
            checkpoint_z_range: (z0, z1) tuple or None. z-slice bounds (in
                on-disk VFF z-index convention) to slice out of each
                checkpoint volume before saving. Required if checkpoint_dir
                is set.
            checkpoint_xy_range: (y0, y1, x0, x1) tuple or None. In-plane
                crop bounds (on-disk VFF y/x convention) applied to each
                checkpoint volume before saving. None (default) keeps the
                full xy plane.
