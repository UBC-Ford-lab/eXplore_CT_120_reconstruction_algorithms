"""Ray generation from cone-beam CT geometry.

Geometry convention (matches FDK in `reconstruction/fdk.py`):

    * Rotation about the z-axis. At theta = 0 the source sits on -x at
      distance R_s from the isocenter; the detector center sits on +x at
      distance R_d. This is the GEHC / FDK convention — see
      `reconstruction/fdk.py:909` where U = R_s + x·cos β + y·sin β
      derives directly from source at -R_s·(cos β, sin β, 0).
    * The detector "a" axis (column index, fast axis in projections) is
      tangent to the source orbit: u_hat = (-sin theta, cos theta, 0).
    * The detector "b" axis (row index) is +z: v_hat = (0, 0, 1).
    * `central_pixel_a` / `central_pixel_b` are the detector indices the
      source-isocenter line passes through. This definition is
      sign-unambiguous: at a = central_pixel_a the pixel sits exactly on
      det_center, which lies on the source->isocentre line by construction.
      CORRECTED 2026-08-11: this docstring used to claim the GEHC acquisition
      software pre-centres the columns so the iso ray lands at the geometric
      centre (N_a-1)/2. It does not. ct_recon's FDK reversed the same belief in
      commit c6c5b57 (2026-07-13) after empirical verification, noting that the
      geometric centre "reconstructs off-isocentre objects non-round".
      dataset._build_geometry now uses the scan.xml CoR converted to the
      sinogram's downsampled index space (geometry.cor_mode: xml).

Pixel position at (theta, b, a):
    p_xyz = +R_d * (cos t, sin t, 0)
            + (a - central_pixel_a) * da * u_hat
            + (b - central_pixel_b) * db * v_hat

Ray = source -> pixel, normalized.

Why we landed here: an earlier convention (source at +R_s·source_dir,
cpa mirrored, u-offset negated) appeared to validate on Scan_1988 because
the phantom is rotationally symmetric — a 180° rotation around z leaves
concentric rings invariant. Scan_1510 (off-isocenter mouse leg) exposed
the bug as a persistent ~5 mm offset that didn't shrink with iterations
or capacity. Aligning with FDK's own convention removes the offset and
keeps the phantom recon visually identical.

    for the ``wls`` data term — the per-pixel inverse variances of exactly the
    measurements this batch scores. The indices are drawn here and nowhere
    else, so this is the one place that gather can be done consistently; the
    subpixel jitter does not move it, a ray inside a pixel is that pixel's
    measurement. Same side-channel pattern as ``sart``'s chord lengths.

    The sinogram-side cost is a single vectorized advanced-index gather
    (`sino[a, b, c]` for n indices) executed in PyTorch C++; for n=1024 random
    indices into a 7 GB tensor this is well under 1 ms on CPU. Building the n
    rays themselves (basis vectors + pixel positions + normalization) is a
    handful of (n, 3)-shape ops — also negligible.
    Per-iter overhead is dominated by the renderer + MLP, not this function.

    ``exclude_angle`` (if set) is never sampled — the held-out validation angle.

    ``subpixel`` (ON by default since 2026-08-22) places each ray uniformly
    inside its detector pixel instead of exactly at the centre. The centre is
    the approximation: a detector pixel
    does not sample a point, it INTEGRATES the beam over its footprint — 84.9 um
    at isocentre on Scan_1988 at downsample 3, which is comparable to a 100 um
    voxel. Sampling the centre models the detector as a grid of delta functions
    when it is physically a grid of boxes, so the forward model is sharper than
    the instrument and the fit has to invent high-frequency structure to
    reconcile the two.

    Because rays are already drawn at random, the fix is free: over iterations
    the jittered ray becomes a Monte-Carlo integral over the pixel footprint,
    and the model is driven to match the pixel MEAN of the line integral. That
    is the linear part of the detector's response. The remaining nonlinearity —
    the detector averages TRANSMISSION, so the true value is
    -ln(mean exp(-p)) rather than mean(p) — needs several rays per pixel
    combined nonlinearly, and matters only where the line integral varies
    steeply within one pixel (rays nearly tangent to a high-contrast surface).

    MEASURED on Scan_1988 (voxel Adam, identical settings either way, 100 um
    grid): volume noise 246.8 -> 212.3 HU and the edge-fringe field 86.3 -> 69.7
    HU peak-to-peak, with the HU level unchanged — achieved while running 13%
    LONGER, which normally adds noise rather than removing it.

    Deliberately NOT applied in `sample_random_rows`: the row samplers feed the
    ramp-filtered and structural losses, which assume samples on the uniform
    detector grid they filter along. Also not applied by `projection.render_projection`,
    which renders whole projections for evaluation: sampling the pixel centre
    there is the MIDPOINT RULE, a deterministic second-order estimate of the
    same pixel mean, and a jittered eval metric would be noisy for no gain.
