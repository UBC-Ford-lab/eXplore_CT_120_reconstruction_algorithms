"""Learning-based iterative reconstruction.

Reconstruction as optimization: a differentiable representation of the volume
(voxel grid, INR, ...) is fitted to the measured line integrals by gradient
descent through a differentiable forward projector. Classical iterative recon
solves the same argmin — this family swaps the hand-derived update rule for
autograd, which is what makes representations exchangeable.

This package holds the CANONICAL copies of the machinery every such algorithm
shares — muNeRF's ``inr_pipeline`` imports from here rather than duplicating:

* ``scene``          — Scene / ModelDomain containers, mm → [-1,1]^3 affine
* ``ray_sampler``    — cone-beam ray generation (the geometry convention)
* ``renderer``       — differentiable line-integral forward operator
* ``detector_warp``  — per-pixel detector distortion applied to ray geometry
* ``training``       — precision, per-group LRs, model compile, grad clipping
* ``trainer``        — the optimization LOOP, independent of the representation

Algorithms live in their own subfolder, and each is only the three answers
``LearnedReconstructor`` cannot guess — what the model is, what the
integration domain is, and how a volume comes out:

* ``voxel``          — dense voxel grid (SIRT's representation).
* ``gaussian``       — anisotropic 3-D Gaussian splatting through the
                       X-ray radiative rasteriser (optional native extension;
                       importing never needs it, reconstructing does).

Each also ships a ``LearnedAlgorithm`` descriptor (``registry``) carrying the
three things the DRIVER cannot guess either — the flags it adds to the CLI,
the constructor arguments it takes, and how much of the machine it needs — and
registers it below. That is what ``--algorithm`` selects over, so adding a
representation touches this package and nothing else: not the driver, not
``ct_core``.
