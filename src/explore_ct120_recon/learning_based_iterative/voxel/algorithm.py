"""The voxel grid as a selectable ``--algorithm``.

Three things the driver cannot know about a representation, kept with the
representation: the flags it adds to the CLI, the constructor arguments it
takes, and how much of the machine it needs. See ``..registry`` for why each
of them is here rather than in ``run_learned_recon.py``.

This is also the file a second representation is copied from, so it is written
to be read that way: every entry says what makes it voxel-specific, not just
what it is.
