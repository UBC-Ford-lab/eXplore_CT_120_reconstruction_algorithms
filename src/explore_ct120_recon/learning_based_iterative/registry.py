"""The learned-algorithm registry: what ``--algorithm`` can name.

``LearnedReconstructor`` is already independent of the representation — it
touches a model only through ``nn.Module`` (``parameters``, ``state_dict``),
queries it as a callable, and duck-types the non-negativity projection. What
was NOT independent was the driver: ``run_learned_recon.py`` imported
``VoxelReconstructor`` directly and constructed it unconditionally, so
``--algorithm`` could only ever name the one class it already had. This module
is the missing half — the place a representation announces itself.

A ``LearnedAlgorithm`` is deliberately more than ``{name: class}``. A registry
of classes alone leaves three things stranded in the driver, and each of them
is where the next representation would otherwise have to add a branch:

* **its own CLI flags.** ``--init-density`` is a voxel-only knob (the
  parameter IS mu, so its starting value is a modelling choice); a network's
  output scale is set by its head instead. Left in the shared parser, every
  algorithm's ``--help`` and every run's config carries knobs that mean
  nothing to it.
* **its own constructor arguments.** Which is the same list, mapped.
* **its own machine footprint.** The voxel grid needs
  ``4 x one-fp32-per-exported-voxel`` of VRAM; a hash grid needs four copies
  of its hash tables, which do not scale with the export grid at all. Guessing
  either from the other is wrong by orders of magnitude in both directions,
  and the preflight is the one place a wrong guess turns into a spurious abort
  or an OOM ten minutes in.

So a new representation is: a ``LearnedReconstructor`` subclass answering the
three hooks, plus one ``LearnedAlgorithm`` describing it, plus a
``register()`` call. Nothing in the driver, nothing in ``ct_core``.

        parser.add_argument('--hash-levels', type=int, default=16, ...)

    def _footprint(args, req):
        n_params = ...                    # from args, not from req.vol_shape
        return Footprint(
            persistent_gpu_bytes=req.param_copies * n_params * 4 + req.sino_bytes,
            host_bytes=2 * req.sino_bytes + req.vol_bytes,
            bytes_per_ray_sample=BATCH_BYTES_PER_SAMPLE,
            notes=(f"Hash grid: {n_params/1e6:.1f}M parameters.",))

    register(LearnedAlgorithm(
        name='hashgrid', reconstructor=HashGridReconstructor,
        summary='multi-resolution hash-grid INR (Instant-NGP)',
        add_args=_add_args, options=_options, footprint=_footprint))

``options`` is used for BOTH the constructor kwargs and the run config, on
purpose: what the algorithm was given is exactly what should be recorded, and
two lists that must agree are two lists that drift. Keep the values scalars —
they are logged, and the run config is a whitelist of geometry and algorithm
numbers. Never put a filesystem path in there.
