"""The learning-based reconstruction loop, independent of the representation.

Reconstruction as optimization is the same loop whatever the volume is
parameterised by: draw rays, render them through the differentiable forward
operator, score against the measured line integrals, step, watch a held-out
projection, stop at the turnover, export. What changes between a dense voxel
grid and a coordinate network is only:

  1. **what the model is**            -> ``build_model`` / ``model_fn=``
  2. **what the integration domain is** -> ``build_domain`` / ``domain_fn=``
  3. **how a volume comes out of it**   -> ``export_volume`` / ``export_fn=``

Everything else — preprocessing, the loss/sampler pairing, the data budget,
the stopping rules, best-iterate restore, the logging hooks — is shared, and
that is the point of this file: before it, the loop lived inside
``voxel/reconstructor.py`` with ``VoxelGrid`` hardcoded in three places, so a
second representation could only be added by copying it.

The domain hook is the one that is easy to underestimate. The default is
``model_domain_from_geometry``, i.e. the integration domain IS the export FOV,
which is right for a backend compared against FDK/SIRT on the same grid. It is
NOT right when rays pass through matter outside the FOV (a scan bed, a holder,
the rest of the specimen in z): that attenuation has to be somewhere in the
model or it lands in the loss as an unmodelled residual. ``Scene`` has always
kept ``model_domain`` and ``export_aabb_*`` apart for exactly this reason; only
this loop had conflated them.

Each hook can be supplied EITHER by subclassing (override the method) OR by
passing a callable to the constructor. The callable wins. Subclass when the
representation is a permanent backend — ``voxel.VoxelReconstructor`` does —
and pass callables when a caller is injecting an experimental model, which is
what muNeRF does.

A CALLER MAY ALSO OWN MORE THAN THE REPRESENTATION. muNeRF owns its data (an
enlarged integration domain, a pooled sinogram, a detector-warp calibration),
its objective (a data term PLUS a self-calibrated structural term, which the
mutually-exclusive ``DATA_TERMS`` registry cannot express), its schedule (FDK
pretrain -> handoff warmup -> main) and its diagnostics (FDK agreement,
bone-band Dice, HU calibration — all of which need the MODEL, not just a
predicted projection). Each of those is a hook rather than a flag, so this
loop never grows a branch per caller:

| hook | signature | for |
|---|---|---|
| ``scene=`` | a ``Scene`` | caller-owned data; nothing is loaded or re-domained here |
| ``loss_fn=`` | ``(pred, target, it) -> Tensor`` | an objective the registry cannot name |
| ``sampler_fn=`` | ``(scene, gen, device) -> (batch_fn, desc)`` | required with ``loss_fn`` — the term dictates the batch SHAPE |
| ``stages=`` | ``[stage(model, scene, device)]`` | pre-main phases with their own objective and optimizer |
| ``extra_loss_fn=`` | ``(model, it, loss) -> Tensor`` | additive volume priors (``loss`` is what a self-calibrated weight balances against) |
| ``render_fn=`` | ``(o, d, model, scene, **kw) -> (M,)`` | a different forward operator (hierarchical, GH-NAF) |
| ``export=`` | ``bool`` | off when the caller exports through its own pipeline |
| ``on_iter=`` | ``(model, it, optimizer) -> dict?`` | per-step schedules; may return ``{"optimizer", "lr_schedule_fn"}`` to hand a staged run to a new network |
| ``on_step=`` | ``(model, it, loss)`` | per-step bookkeeping (checkpoints, a loss history) |
| ``lr_schedule_fn=`` | ``(it) -> multiplier`` | a caller-owned LR schedule; multiplier form keeps per-group ratios |
| ``on_eval=`` | ``(model, scene, it, metrics) -> dict`` | volume-domain diagnostics; returned scalars join the log stream |
| ``optimizer_fn=`` | ``(model) -> Optimizer`` | a caller-owned parameter grouping |
| ``early_stopper=`` | ``EarlyStopper`` | share ONE stopper when the caller reads it too |
| ``snapshot_fn=`` / ``restore_fn=`` | ``() -> state`` / ``(state)`` | when "the model" is more than one module |
| ``lr_plateau=`` | ``PlateauLRReducer`` | closed-loop LR; takes over at the end of warmup |
| ``on_lr_stage=`` | ``(volume_mu, it, stage, lr, geometry=None, slug=None) -> None`` | the volume at every LR change, for a scrollable record of the stages; a backend that renders the export grid itself passes ``geometry`` (nothing to crop) and may name the frame with ``slug`` |

``render_fn`` returns ONE prediction because that is what the loss is scored
on. An operator with more outputs — hierarchical's coarse AND fine, GH-NAF's
uncertainty and attention — returns the one that is scored and leaves the rest
in a closure the caller's ``loss_fn`` also sees. The two hooks are supplied by
the same caller, so sharing state between them needs no API for it.

``lr_plateau`` also changes when the run ENDS: with a reducer present, patience
running out buys a reduction instead of a stop, and training ends only once the
LR is at its floor and the metric still will not improve. Without it the
open-loop cosine owns the LR and the stopper ends the run on its own.
