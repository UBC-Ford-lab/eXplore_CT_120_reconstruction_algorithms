Cone-beam CT reconstruction for the GE eXplore CT 120 micro-CT scanner.
Point it at a scan folder and get a calibrated HU volume back.

![Cone-beam reconstruction: a ray from the source through the volume to a detector pixel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-Ford-lab/eXplore_CT_120_reconstruction_algorithms/main/assets/voxel_model.png)

*Each detector pixel measures a line integral of the attenuation μ along a
ray from the source. Reconstruction recovers the volume, here a dense voxel
grid, from those measurements.*

| Family | Algorithms | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Analytic (`fdk/`) | FDK with ramp / Shepp-Logan / cosine / Hamming windows, Parker weighting | PyTorch |
| Classical iterative (`iterative/`) | ASTRA: SIRT, CGLS, SART. TIGRE: OS-SART, SART, SIRT, MLEM, +TV | CUDA + ASTRA or TIGRE |
| Learning-based (`learning_based_iterative/`) | Differentiable projector + gradient descent. `--algorithm voxel` (dense grid, the default) or `--algorithm gaussian` (anisotropic 3-D Gaussian splatting through an X-ray rasteriser, with a counts-weighted least-squares loss); other representations pluggable | CUDA (+ the rasteriser for `gaussian`) |

All three share the same loading, preprocessing, geometry calibration, HU
calibration and output format, so their volumes are directly comparable.

Python 3.10+ and PyTorch 2.0+. The import name is `explore_ct120_recon`.

## Usage

Six commands are installed:

```bash
ct120-fdk data/scans/Scan_1988
ct120-iterative data/scans/Scan_1988 --backend astra --algorithm SIRT3D_CUDA --iterations 100
ct120-iterative data/scans/Scan_1988 --backend tigre --algorithm ossart --tv-lambda 10
ct120-learned data/scans/Scan_1988 --downsample 3
ct120-learned data/scans/Scan_1988 --algorithm gaussian
ct120-volume-report VOLUME.vff
ct120-projection-report data/scans/Scan_1988 --volume a.vff --volume b.vff
ct120-geometry-calibration data/scans/Scan_1988
```

(`python -m explore_ct120_recon.run_fdk_recon ...` is the same thing.)

A scan folder holds the projection `.vff` files, `scan.xml`, and the
`bright.vff` / `dark.vff` flat-field frames. Each run writes a `.vff`
volume next to the scan folder, a `.json` sidecar with the grid and the
fitted HU map, and a `_plots/` folder with slices, histogram and projection
diagnostics. `--help` lists every flag.

## Pipeline

```
raw projections → flat-field + log → air normalization + ring correction
  → detector rotation calibration (measured once per scan, cached)
  → FDK | ASTRA / TIGRE | learned
  → μ (mm⁻¹) → HU calibration → .vff + .json + plots
```

Defaults that matter, each with a `--no-...` or explicit override:

- **Field of view and ROI are `auto`**: the grid is what the detector
  subtends, tightened to the object; the export region is the scanner's own
  `SubVolumeCoordinates.xml` box, so results line up with the vendor volume.
- **Model domain `auto`** (iterative and learned): backends that fit the
  projections cover everything a ray crosses, bed included, otherwise the
  missing attenuation becomes a smooth HU bias. `--roi` then only crops the
  output.
- **HU calibration** fits two anchors from the volume's own histogram: air
  at −1000 HU and bulk soft tissue at `--tissue-hu` (default +120, use 0 for
  a water phantom). No phantom or scanner constant needed.
- **Preflight** estimates VRAM and RAM before allocating anything.
  `--preflight-only` just prints the report.
- **Weights & Biases** logging is on when `--wandb-project` or
  `$WANDB_PROJECT` names a project; nothing is hardcoded and nothing is
  uploaded otherwise.

## Learning-based reconstruction

Fits a volume model to the line integrals through a differentiable ray
tracer, with Adam, non-negativity, LR warmup and plateau reduction, and a
held-out projection for early stopping. Main flags: `--loss` (`mse`,
`huber`, `ssim`, `msssim`, `sart`, ...), `--iterations`, `--rays-per-batch`
(sized from free VRAM by default), `--emulate-sart`, `--compile`.

A new representation only has to answer three hooks in a
`LearnedReconstructor` subclass: `build_model`, `build_domain`,
`export_volume`. Register it with a `LearnedAlgorithm` descriptor and it
becomes an `--algorithm` choice; `voxel/` is the 100-line example and
`gaussian/` the full-size one (its own per-view training loop, seeding from
an FDK of the scan, a measured noise model, shape constraints). A descriptor
may also re-default the shared flags for its representation
(`driver_defaults`: binning, iteration cap, stopping metric — `gaussian` runs
at `--downsample 3` with an SSIM stopper unless told otherwise). A
representation in another package works the same way via
`--algorithm-module my_package.algorithms`, and may subclass
`GaussianReconstructor` through its seams (`_render_train`, `_render_eval`,
`_param_groups`, `_regularise`, `_state` / `_restore_state`,
`_checkpoint_payload`) to change what is rasterised without touching the
loop.

## Report tools

`ct120-volume-report` draws slices, the HU histogram and the fitted anchors
for any finished volume, including the vendor's. `ct120-projection-report`
forward-projects one or more volumes and scores them against the measured
projections on the same angles and detector window.
`ct120-geometry-calibration` pre-measures the detector rotation, for
example on a GPU node before submitting long jobs. Use `--vendor` with the
report tools for a GE volume; it applies the vendor's axis conventions and
locates the ROI from the scan.

Everything is importable too:

```python
from explore_ct120_recon.ct_core.vff_io import read_vff, write_vff
from explore_ct120_recon.learning_based_iterative import LearnedReconstructor
```

## Layout

```
src/explore_ct120_recon/
  run_*.py                    drivers, one per family plus the report tools
  ct_core/                    shared: scan loading, preprocessing, geometry
                              calibration, HU calibration, preflight, VFF I/O
  fdk/                        filtered backprojection
  iterative/{astra,tigre}/    toolbox wrappers
  learning_based_iterative/   trainer, ray sampler, renderer, losses, voxel/
```

Detector calibrations measured from a scan are cached in `data/calibration/`
of the checkout when running from source, in the per-user data directory
(`~/.local/share/explore_ct120_recon/calibration` on Linux) for an installed
copy, or wherever `$CT_CALIBRATION_DIR` points.
